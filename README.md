# LedTimeline

This is our project for HooHacks, UVA 2025 (HOO Hacks)

In this project we used Rasberry pi and Pico pi WH and plugged it into the breadboard. We give hotspot to the boad and pi with our phone so that the pico could extract any data online.

The pico has the api server key which it takes the current time and updates the time every minute automatically from that server. 

The pico lights up the amounts of led to show how much time in the has been passed
